                            by Walt Whitman<br>
                        <br>
                        O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,<br>
                        The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,<br>
                        The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,<br>
                        While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;<br>
                                                But O heart! heart! heart!<br>
                                                    O the bleeding drops of red,<br>
                                                    Where on the deck my Captain lies,<br>
                                                        Fallen cold and dead.<br>
                                                        <br>
                        O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;<br>
                        Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills,<br>
                        For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding,<br>
                        For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;<br>
                                                Here Captain! dear father!<br>
                                                    This arm beneath your head!<br>
                                                    It is some dream that on the deck,<br>
                                                        You’ve fallen cold and dead.<br>
                                                        <br>
                        My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,<br>
                        My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,<br>
                        The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,<br>
                        From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;<br>
                                                Exult O shores, and ring O bells!<br>
                                                    But I with mournful tread,<br>
                                                    Walk the deck my Captain lies,<br>
                                                        Fallen cold and dead.<br>
